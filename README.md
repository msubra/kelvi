## Customizations

Kelvi allows you to make customizations as much as possible. Since this is designed for developers, It allows customizations to most of the part. 

* Add / Remove new topics to watch
* Modify the update frequency
* Modify number of questions to be displayed per topic ( 8(2^3) seems to be optimal, 5 is less and more than 8 is lot)
* Modify how many different watches you want to track on a topic. (Active, New, Unanswered, Featured). Some topics may get Featured rarely, in that case you can disable the watch to not fetch data.
* What is the default watch to be displayed, while launching the app.

## Chrome App

Kelvi is also available as Chrome app. Get the [chrome app package](build/kelvi-chrome-app-1.0.zip) and load as [unpacked Extension](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked).
